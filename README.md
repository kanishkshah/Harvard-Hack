# Fantasy Formula - Web 3


This is an open source project created for the Hackathon at Harvard hosted by Easy A from July 27-28. 

# Summary

Fantasy sports have a track record of doing well in terms of monetization. With a large organic growth rate, the product markets itself.

This is a place where people can compete in their knowledge of Formula one. Everytime the gap closes between two cars, predict if there will be an overtake. Based on your overall performance, you will get assigned Dynamic NFTs showing your rank to the rest of the world. 

Drive to survive already proved that the world is interested in who the drivers are as people, this draws on that very factor, which is why fantasy sports are so lucrative.

# NFTs are have tangible value:

Based on the odds of a given overtake, you will get certain achievements. The rarer the achievement, the rarer the prediction, the higher the value

Based on the rank of the participants (based on sum of achievement values), top n candidates them can be invited, and meet their favorite driver. Hence it acts like an event pass. 

In short, it gives enthusiasts of Formula one exactly what they like the most.

Eventually this idea can be expanded on (creating content out of the top participants), etc. I would bet that it would create interesting content if the best predictors were in the same room, trying to throw each other off, etc.


# Technical description: 

It uses Unique Network to setup NFTs (mostly Native NFTs) for the project. These are also dynamic. The only NFTs so far are the rank based NFTs. Imagine if your rank is lagging, you might want to try and purchase a higher rank achievement to increase the chances of getting through. Besides, its also going to be used for content, and who doesn't want to be featured?
